drinksoda.cpp

	The user enters three values, the number of empty soda bottles at the start of the day, the number of empty soda
	bottles found throughout the day, and the number of empty soda bottles that need to be recycled for a new soda to
	be purchased. Given these numbers, the program will find the number of new sodas purchasable by the end of the day.
	This number includes recycling the soda bottles you will buy at the end of the day.

	How to run:

magicnumber.cpp

	A Magic number is a number which is evenly divisible by the sum of its digits. This program will determine if a given 
	number is a "magic number". If the given number is not a magic number, the program will find the next closest
	magic number that is larger than the number provided.

	How to run:
		1.) g++ -std=c++11 magicnumber.cpp
		2.) ./a.out
		3.) Enter requested input

sticks.cpp

	"Sticks" refers to the number line segments that make up a number on a digital clock.
	For example...
	The number "1" is made up of two sticks, and the number "8" is made up of seven sticks.
	This program finds the largest, and smallest numbers that can be created given a user-inputed number of sticks.

	How to run:
		1.) g++ -std=c++11 sticks.cpp
		2.) ./a.out
